Starting work on the EGA code module.
- Only a few graphics functions are implemented, line drawing, pixels, circles and filled boxes
- What I have written is in pure pascal and has not been optimised yet - only filled boxes is currently faster than BGI
- still have image operations left to do.

The BGI code for 16 colour EGA graphics is pretty darn fast! I imagine it will be difficult for me to even achieve speed parity for some operations. Fortunately I believe that my code will eventually be faster for images and filled boxes, but that is yet to be seen.

Fixed a serious bug where the game would cause a crash in the next bit of software run (whatever it is)
It was caused by incorrectly coding the exit procedures in the graphics libraries. Basically once an exitproc is in the chain it
should not remove itself before the program termination process, otherwise it will break the chain and some exit procedure won't be run which will cause problems for the next program to run. Especially if interrupts are left in place.

This commit fixes that bug by remaking the exit procedures for CGA, VGA and VESA (even though it's not used yet)
Some other minor changes are included but aren't significant.

XT - changes a message to reflect being compile for a different target (in future will do more)

to add /B to build all files.

Some behaviour correction for projectiles and a minor change to VGA.PAS to reduce stack use.
Most changes were in VESA.PAS where I've been working on the VESA graphics implementation.
- most Functions work in some capacity except the XOR image drawing (XOR needs to be implemented)
- filledBox needs to be re-written in assembly, partly to fix drawing over the window boundaries
- Line drawing is using putPixel, it needs to be changed to write directly to memory instead for speed.
It's not yet ready for including as a valid graphics mode, but shouldn't take much longer.

Significant performance increase on XT machines...
- mostly due to the status bar update code. It was doing some unnecessary drawing and did some in a slow way.
  I've improved it's efficiency and performance on slower machines has leapt forward!
- implemented some code in gcommon in assembly as it is called frequently.

Still need to improve the cga line drawing speed, perhaps also need to tweak the distances in which enemies appear and disappear on low performance machines, and perhaps also the number of bullets. (and shooting conditions)

Massive debug and coding session!
- added font scaling to bfont - so the title screen looks correct.
- reverted and modified a change in bmenu, so that future graphics modes (ega,vesa) will look correct
- fixed a bug with bobgraph where I was using an incorrect coordinate for getimage which caused crashes.
- after having fixed the serious crashing bugs reinstated turning off stack and range checking.
- changed many of the parameters in VGA and CGA from integer to word.
- Fixed serious bugs in CGA.pas
  - filledBox had a bug where it would fill the entire screen (and more memory) if the box met certain requirements - Fixed
  - corrected issues with font rendering by masking the colour to $3 so that we don't accidentally draw to other pixels.
  - removed BGI files as they are no longer needed! Disk space and memory savings hurray!

Game seems to work well in both the CGA and VGA modes now, and I haven't found any more serious bugs.
- need to re-introduce EGA and VESA graphics modes.
- might do some conditional define magic to make it possible to compile a version specific to XT machines to save memory.

Initial work on converting graphics code to using new libraries.
 -Bobgraph, Bfont and pgs form the core that everything else should use.
 -CGA and VGA are the device specific code for drawing. Will implement EGA and VESA later.

Fixed a some bugs
- putimage in CGA would draw incorrectly on odd lines. corrected the bank switching to account for this.

Have had numerous bugs to fix, however the editor and the game *mostly* work.
Bugs remaining.
- CGA filledBox seems to fill entire screen when a narrow box is specified. probably an overflow error.
- The code that saves and restores a large screen segment seems to cause crashes, and doesn't draw correctly.
   I suspect the put/get code doesn't handle larger images well. Will have to fire up a debugger!

Some more optimisation of CGA.PAS

Image operations now work first on one CGA memory bank, then the other.
This reduces the amount of calulations required for the ofset between rows.
But expands the code signifcantly. It has also meant I could remove the
push cx as I have more register space.

More work on the CGA unit
- implemented drawing with XOR
- optimised the standard draw, changed calculations to bit twiddling where I can

Made larger change to image storage, storing 4 copies of the image pre-shifted bitwise to positions
ready for different x and $3 values.
Cons:
   takes up loads more memory 164 versus 34
Pros:
   significantly faster

might be a problem on low memory systems, but will make it more likely this will work on an XT.

More work on the CGA routines.
- created the putImage routine in assembly - seems faster than BGI on real hardware (386sx)
  will test on 86Box for lower spec machines

might not be the optimal way to draw to CGA. I basically shift the buffer to the right pixel at
draw time which costs time. I could store pre-shifted pixels, but this would quadruple the amount
of image memory per image.
for 10x10 image
BGI memory usage 46
CGA unit usage now 34
potential CGA unit usage 164 .... yikes even more than higher resolutions.

- minor logic improvement in bobgraph collision code.

Made some major changes in an attempt to improve performance for XT class machines.
* first made it possible to run on XT machines by compiling for 8086 instead of 80286
* Changed pitdbl to be able to keep time by number of ticks for timing through out the game. Can now select how much faster
  than standard PIT speed.
* Modified game engine to use new timing mechanism in pitdbl
* Modified bconfig to store new timing information (number of ticks * 2)
* Modified bmenu to use new timing mechanism
* Removed old time.pas as it's no longer needed.

This improved the performance by more than I was expecting, a turbo XT seems playable with some slow-down where there's a busy area. It's probably not the best experience there, but it does work.

Finally found source of the most serious crash on real machines. It was caused by using 8087/80287 instructions during an interrupt with no actual NPU/FPU in the system.

The cure is to remove the 8087/80287 emulation and change the compiler to not generate instructions for the NPU/FPU. Some code where I was using the data type single had to be changed to real, which is ok as I mostly don't use the extra precision. 

This explains why it worked in dosbox (FPU is always enabled) and on more modern hardware (anything with a built in FPU).
Thanks to 86box for being the tool which enabled me to find this particularly tricky bug!

Now to figure out why I had decided to use the floating point instructions/emulation.

* a movable cursor
* ability to move between pages.

created a unit for creating the graphics files using the RLE compression recently created. Have adapted egaconv

completed level 5 (castle) ready for testing... I noted that the save system and 
episode list system working together make a bug where adding a level to an 
episode doesn't effect saved games. ie. If you saved in the last level after any 
addition (or removal) it still thinks you're on the last level. not sure if I'll 
fix that.
